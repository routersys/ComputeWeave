ComputeWeave is a fork of [ComputeSharp](https://github.com/Sergio0694/ComputeSharp), the library that lets DirectX 12 compute shaders be written entirely in C#.
That base is unchanged and is documented upstream; this document covers what the fork adds on top of it.
The addition is a declarative layer: a compute pipeline and its resources are declared with attributes, a source generator turns the declaration into a canonical binary descriptor embedded in the assembly, and the runtime reads that descriptor to bind resources, record command lists and track completion.
The same layer carries shared textures and shared fences across the Direct3D 11 and Direct3D 12 boundary, and adds a GPU memory budget.

## Overview

The base library is unchanged. A compute shader is a `partial struct` implementing `IComputeShader`, `GraphicsDevice.GetDefault()` returns the device, and `For` dispatches. Nothing in this document replaces that.

What the fork adds is 67 public types and additional members on `GraphicsDevice` and `InteropServices`. They form one system. A type marked `[ComputePipelineHost]` declares a device field, a set of resource slots and a set of pipeline methods. The source generator reads that declaration, writes a canonical descriptor as a byte array in the generated partial, and emits typed members that forward to the runtime. At construction the runtime parses the descriptor, validates every contract against it, and from then on the descriptor is the single source of truth for ordinals, resource access and structural limits.

Resources are not held directly. They live in slots that publish generations: `TryEnsure` asks a slot to match a requested plan, and a new generation is published only when the plan actually changes. Work in flight keeps the generation it captured alive, so resizing a resource does not invalidate submissions already recorded.

### What is guaranteed

Every path that reaches the GPU through this library is tracked. Lifetime tracking answers whether a native resource may be released. Hazard tracking answers whether accesses to it are ordered across queues. They are separate properties, and the library states which of them it provides.

| Path | Lifetime | Hazard |
|---|---|---|
| Generated pipelines, `ComputeContext`, resource copies, interop domains | Yes | Yes |
| `InteropServices.AcquireNativeResource` and `AcquireNativeDevice` | Yes | No |
| `InteropServices.GetID3D12Resource`, `GetID3D12Device` and the mapped views of transfer resources | No | No |

A native reference holds the resource generation alive while an object outside the library uses it, and reports the completion points of the work already submitted so the holder can order its own work without blocking. It does not order that work for you. Interoperation that needs ordering uses an interop domain instead.

The last row is the escape hatch inherited from the base library. It is kept for compatibility and stays untracked.

## Installation

```bash
dotnet add package ComputeWeave
```

Optional extension packages:

```bash
dotnet add package ComputeWeave.Dxc
dotnet add package ComputeWeave.D3D12MemoryAllocator
```

A companion package for writing Direct2D pixel shaders:

```bash
dotnet add package ComputeWeave.D2D1
```

`ComputeWeave.Core` is a transitive dependency and is not referenced directly. `ComputeWeave.D2D1` shares it with the packages above and does not reference `ComputeWeave`.

## Features

### Declarative compute pipelines

A host is a `partial` type marked with `[ComputePipelineHost]`. The first argument names the field holding the device, the second is the number of concurrent invocations to reserve. A pipeline is a method marked `[ComputePipeline]` whose first parameter is `in ComputeContext`.

```csharp
using ComputeWeave;

[ComputePipelineHost("device", 1)]
public sealed partial class Host
{
    private readonly GraphicsDevice device;

    [ComputePipelineResource(ComputeResourceAccess.ReadWrite, ComputeResourceRecovery.Recompute)]
    private readonly ComputeResourceSlot<ReadWriteBuffer<int>> index = new();

    [ComputePipeline]
    private void Run(in ComputeContext context)
    {
    }
}
```

The generator emits into the same partial type a static `Create` factory, `Dispose`, `WaitForDisposal`, and for each pipeline an overload of the same name that takes the declared arguments without the context and returns `ComputeSubmission`. The overload is public unless a parameter type is less accessible.

```csharp
using Host host = Host.Create(GraphicsDevice.GetDefault(), maximumPendingSubmissions: 4);

ComputeSubmission submission = host.Run();

submission.Wait();
```

`ComputeSubmission` carries a `FencePoint`, a `ComputeSubmissionStatus` and `IsCompleted`. Waiting is explicit; a submission is not awaited implicitly at disposal.

### Owned resource slots

A resource owned by a host is declared as a field of `ComputeResourceSlot<TResource>` or `ComputeResourceGroupSlot<TGroup>`, annotated with `[ComputePipelineResource]` and initialized with `new()`. The `TGroup` of a group slot is a `sealed partial class` marked with `[ComputeResourceGroup]`, whose members are get-only properties annotated with `[ComputePipelineResource]`. The generator emits `TryEnsure<Slot>(in <Plan> plan, out bool changed)` and, for single-resource slots, `Get<Slot>ComputeBinding()` returning a `ComputeResourceBinding<TResource>`.

`TryEnsure` reports whether the owned resources match the requested plan, and `changed` reports whether a new generation was published. `ComputeResourceRecovery` selects what happens to the contents when a generation is replaced: `Discardable`, `RecreateFromHost`, `Recompute` or `CapacityOnly`.

A pipeline reaches the owned resources through a parameter marked with `[ComputeOwnedResource]`, naming the slot field. A `ComputeResourceSlot<TResource>` provides its `TResource`, a `ComputeResourceGroupSlot<TGroup>` provides its `TGroup` with every member assigned. Such a parameter is removed from the generated overload, as the caller does not supply it, and it refers to the generation pinned for that invocation rather than to whichever generation is active while the body runs.

```csharp
[ComputePipeline]
private void Run(
    in ComputeContext context,
    [ComputeOwnedResource(nameof(index))] ReadWriteBuffer<int> index,
    [ComputeOwnedResource(nameof(grid))] GridResources grid)
{
    context.For(index.Length, new Shader(index, grid.Cells));
}
```

### Direct3D 11 interoperation

An external API is connected as a domain. One is shipped for the Direct3D 11 immediate context; any other API is connected by implementing `IComputeExternalInteropProvider<TView>` yourself. The provider is asked to initialize a shared timeline, to enqueue signals and waits on its own queue, and to open a shared texture as its own view type.

```csharp
using ComputeInteropDomain domain = device.RegisterExternalDomain(provider);
```

`ComputeInteropDomain` exposes `Device`, `Id`, `Capabilities` and the disposal pair `Dispose` / `WaitForDisposal`. `ExternalInteropCapabilities` reports `SharedFence`, `SharedTexture2D`, `SingleImmediateContextOrdering` and `PersistentExternalViewOrdering`.

You do not have to write a provider to drive a Direct3D 11 immediate context. `ComputeExternalDirect3D11Provider` opens the shared fence, enqueues the signals, the waits and the flush, opens the shared textures and creates the external views. It takes the device, the immediate context and the render target as raw COM pointers, so it stays independent of the Direct3D 11 bindings you use.

```csharp
using ComputeExternalQueueScheduler scheduler = ComputeExternalQueueScheduler.Create();
ComputeExternalDirect3D11Provider provider = new(device, immediateContext, renderTarget, scheduler);
using ComputeInteropDomain domain = graphicsDevice.RegisterExternalDomain(provider);
```

`ComputeExternalQueueScheduler.Create()` returns a scheduler serializing the reservations of one immediate context into a single flight. Providers enqueueing onto the same context share one instance, and you keep that mapping: the library never observes the immediate context as a type, so it cannot check the mapping for you.

The `ExternalDirect3D11TextureView` it creates holds the opened texture, and the bitmap over it when a render target was given. `Texture` and `Bitmap` are borrowed and must not be released. Use `AddRefTexture()` and `AddRefBitmap()` to hand a pointer to your own bindings: they return a reference you own, so the binding can take ownership of it.

A host whose external side is a Direct3D 12 command queue of its own device uses `ComputeExternalDirect3D12Provider` the same way. It opens the shared fence and the shared textures on its device, signals and waits on the queue, and its `FlushAfterSignal` does nothing because a Direct3D 12 queue has no deferred batching to flush. The `ExternalDirect3D12TextureView` it creates exposes the opened resource as `Resource`, borrowed, with `AddRefResource()` returning a reference you own.

```csharp
using ComputeExternalQueueScheduler scheduler = ComputeExternalQueueScheduler.Create();
ComputeExternalDirect3D12Provider provider = new(d3D12Device, d3D12Queue, scheduler);
using ComputeInteropDomain domain = graphicsDevice.RegisterExternalDomain(provider);
```

The graphics device the domain is registered on has to run on the adapter of the provider. `GraphicsDevice.TryGetDevice` resolves it from the identity, so a host does not spell out how the two are matched.

```csharp
if (!GraphicsDevice.TryGetDevice(new ExternalAdapterIdentity(adapterLuid), out GraphicsDevice? graphicsDevice))
{
    return;
}
```

Providers whose queue must be entered and left around each operation derive a `ComputeExternalQueueScheduler`.

A provider that throws leaves its external queue in a state the runtime cannot reason about, so the domain is poisoned. Every subsequent operation on that domain, and every borrow or lease taken from it, reports the failure the provider raised. Other domains on the same device are unaffected.

Rejections carry an identifier. `ComputeDiagnosticException` derives from `InvalidOperationException` and reports a stable `DiagnosticId` such as `CMPW3004`. Whether to retry, rebuild the resource or tear the domain down differs per identifier. **Do not tell rejections apart by their message.** Messages change with the implementation.

### Shared texture slots

A resource set is a `partial` type marked `[ComputeInteropResourceSet]` holding `SharedTextureSlot<T, TPixel, TView>` fields annotated with `[ComputeSharedTexture]`. The attribute fixes the resize policy, the access on each side, the external usage, the alpha mode, the initial owner and the recovery.

```csharp
using System;
using ComputeWeave;

[ComputeInteropResourceSet]
public sealed partial class ResourceSet
{
    [ComputeSharedTexture(
        ComputeResourceResizePolicy.Exact,
        ComputeResourceAccess.ReadWrite,
        ExternalResourceAccess.Write,
        ExternalTextureUsage.RenderTarget,
        ComputeAlphaMode.Premultiplied,
        ComputeSharedTextureInitialOwner.External,
        ComputeResourceRecovery.RecreateFromHost)]
    private readonly SharedTextureSlot<Bgra32, Float4, ExternalView> source;
}
```

The generator emits `Create(GraphicsDevice device, ComputeInteropDomain domain)` and, per slot, `TryEnsure<Slot>(int width, int height, out bool changed)`. `TryGet<Slot>AllocatedSize` delegates to `SharedTextureSlot.TryGetAllocatedSize` and reports the allocated width and height of the published texture, which can remain larger than the logical dimensions under `GrowOnly`. The result is an unpinned snapshot and does not describe a binding, borrow or lease acquired separately when generation replacement can run concurrently. The `Width` and `Height` of an `ExternalTextureLease<TView>` describe the allocated dimensions of the generation held by that lease. Ownership is handed over through the shared fence: `BeginExternalOperation` borrows the view for the external API, `AcquireExternalViewLease` takes a lease that outlives a single operation, and `GetComputeBinding` returns the compute-side binding.

Retiring a shared texture generation, whether by resizing it or by disposing its slot, drains the external queue before the external view is released. That drain runs on the device rather than on the calling thread, so the retired generation is still held when `TryEnsure` or `Dispose` returns. A foreground operation waits when that internal maintenance operation temporarily holds the domain, while another foreground operation remains a conflicting use and is rejected. A provider that throws poisons its domain, and every later operation on that domain reports the failure. `WaitForDisposal` waits for retirement and disposal to complete.

### Read-only buffer views

`ReadWriteBuffer<T>.AsReadOnly()` returns an `IReadOnlyBuffer<T>`. The view binds the same resource through its SRV, so a shader taking it cannot write to it.

```csharp
using ReadWriteBuffer<int> source = device.AllocateReadWriteBuffer<int>(length);

device.For(length, new ProduceShader(source));
device.For(length, new ConsumeShader(source.AsReadOnly(), destination));
```

A buffer produced on the GPU can be handed to later shaders as read-only without copying it into a read-only buffer. Copying between two `Buffer<T>` instances blocks the CPU until the GPU completes, so this keeps that wait out of a per-frame path.

Unlike the texture counterparts, no state transition is involved: a buffer resides in `COMMON` and needs no transition to be read through an SRV. The returned view stays valid for the whole lifetime of the buffer and can be cached and reused. `ReadOnlyBuffer<T>` also implements `IReadOnlyBuffer<T>`, so either one can be passed to the same parameter.

### GPU memory budget

`GraphicsDevice` gains three members. `SetMemoryPolicy` installs hard limits per memory segment and, optionally, an `IGraphicsMemoryBudgetBroker` that arbitrates between clients. `GetMemoryStatistics` returns a `GraphicsMemoryStatistics` snapshot carrying an epoch, per-segment statistics and generation counts. `TrimMemory` releases what is retired and idle. A generation is idle only once the work and the external queue that held it are done with it, so trimming right after the call that retired it reclaims nothing.

Allocation failures caused by the budget surface as `GraphicsMemoryAllocationException`, which derives from `InvalidOperationException`.

The budget covers the resources the device creates itself. A device using an allocator configured through `AllocationServices.ConfigureAllocatorFactory`, such as the one in the `ComputeWeave.D3D12MemoryAllocator` package, creates its resources through that allocator instead. Those resources are not admitted against the policy, are not counted in the statistics and are not reclaimed by `TrimMemory`. Budget them in the allocator.

**A configured allocator and the declarative layer are mutually exclusive.** Generations, trimming and the budget all rest on the device owning its allocations, so a device that allocates through an external allocator cannot host them: `ComputeHostRuntime.Create`, `ComputeInteropResourceSetRuntime.Create` and the generated `Create` factories throw `NotSupportedException` on it. The base library, `ComputeContext`, resource copies and `InteropServices` are unaffected. Pick one of the two.

### Compile-time validation

The declarations above are checked by analyzers that report 112 diagnostics with the `CMPW` prefix, covering attribute placement, host and pipeline method shape, slot declaration, resource contracts and generated overload conflicts. Some carry a code fix.

### Direct2D pixel shaders

`ComputeWeave.D2D1` writes Direct2D pixel shaders in C#. It is a companion package rather than an extension: it shares `ComputeWeave.Core` with the compute library and does not reference `ComputeWeave`. Direct2D executes these shaders, not the Direct3D 12 compute queue, so nothing here creates or uses a `GraphicsDevice`, and the declarative layer above does not apply to them.

A pixel shader is a `partial struct` implementing `ID2D1PixelShader`.

```csharp
using ComputeWeave;
using ComputeWeave.D2D1;

[D2DInputCount(1)]
[D2DInputSimple(0)]
[D2DShaderProfile(D2D1ShaderProfile.PixelShader50)]
[D2DGeneratedPixelShaderDescriptor]
public readonly partial struct DifferenceEffect(float amount) : ID2D1PixelShader
{
    public float4 Execute()
    {
        float4 color = D2D.GetInput(0);
        float3 rgb = Hlsl.Saturate(this.amount - color.RGB);

        return new(rgb, 1);
    }
}
```

The bytecode and the constant buffer are available without a device, and `D2D1PixelShaderEffect` registers a shader as a Direct2D effect and creates `ID2D1Effect` instances from it. `D2D1ReflectionServices` reports the generated HLSL and the shader statistics.

```csharp
ReadOnlyMemory<byte> bytecode = D2D1PixelShader.LoadBytecode<DifferenceEffect>();
ReadOnlyMemory<byte> buffer = D2D1PixelShader.GetConstantBuffer(new DifferenceEffect(1));
```

The declarations are checked by analyzers that report 99 diagnostics with the `CMPWD2D` prefix. Shaders are compiled to DXBC with FXC, which is what Direct2D accepts; `d3dcompiler_47.dll` ships with Windows, so the package bundles no compiler of its own.

### Generated HLSL

`IComputeShaderDescriptor<T>.HlslSource` returns the HLSL the generator wrote for a shader type. The shipped path compiles it as `cs_6_0` through DXC, but the text is plain HLSL and can be taken out and compiled elsewhere, for a Direct3D 11 device of your own among others.

It is written for shader model 6. An older profile takes it only where the shader stays inside what that profile offers, so FXC compiles many of these shaders but not all: a group barrier reached under the range check the entry point applies, a typed UAV store that does not write every component, and intrinsics added after shader model 5 are each rejected there. None of that is a property of the text's bindings, which the rest of this section describes.

The text describes its own bindings. Whatever a caller has to bind appears in the text: the entry point, the constant buffer with every field it holds, and every resource with its register. Nothing is left to be recovered from the generator, so a compiler's own reflection over the text gives the complete binding table.

| What | Where it is stated |
|---|---|
| Entry point | The function carrying the `[numthreads(...)]` attribute. It is named `Execute`. |
| Thread group size | The three constants the `[numthreads(...)]` attribute reads, defined at the top of the text. |
| Constant buffer | A `cbuffer` declaration with its own register. Its layout is the standard HLSL packing of the fields it declares. |
| Resources | Each declares its own register. A sampler that omits the index resolves to `s0`. |

The shapes themselves are not promised. Which fields the constant buffer opens with, and the order resources take their registers, are free to change between versions; a release that changes them says so in its notes. What does not change is that the text states them, so a caller that reads the bindings out of the text it compiles stays correct across versions. A caller that hardcodes an offset measured from one version does not.

The companion Direct2D package reaches the same end by a different route, so do not carry this shape over to it. Its pixel shader text names `d2d1effecthelpers.hlsli` in an `#include` and builds the entry point out of that header's macros, which is also what gathers the captured values into the constant buffer Direct2D binds. A caller compiling that text needs the header, which the Windows SDK ships. The captured values themselves are still declared in the text.

## Limitations

- Windows only. The library uses Direct3D 12 and does not run on other operating systems.
- Shared textures are fixed to `Bgra8Unorm`. The native descriptor of every shared texture generation is fixed, so `ExternalTextureFormat` declares that one member and a shared texture slot only stores the pixel type it maps to. A slot declared with another pixel type is rejected when its resource set is created.
- `ExternalTextureUsage` declares `Sampled` and `RenderTarget`. It selects how the provider opens the external view and does not change the native descriptor.
- The body of a compute shader is limited to the C# constructs the generator can translate to HLSL. A construct outside that range is reported at compile time. Where the generator has a diagnostic for it, that diagnostic points at the source; where it does not, the HLSL compiler reports the failure against the generated code.
- A shader that reaches `AllMemoryBarrierWithGroupSync`, `DeviceMemoryBarrierWithGroupSync` or `GroupMemoryBarrierWithGroupSync` can only be dispatched over an extent that is a whole multiple of its thread group size on every axis. The dispatch rounds the extent up to whole groups and the entry point runs the body only for the threads inside the requested range, so a partial group would leave some of its threads short of the barrier. The generator decides this from the barriers the body reaches and marks such a shader by writing `IComputeShaderDescriptor<T>.RequiresFullThreadGroups` as `true`, so there is nothing to declare by hand and a shader that grows a barrier is marked by the next build. The dispatch reads that mark and rejects a partial extent with `ArgumentException`. The base library does not reject it. `ThreadGroupAlignment.AlignX`, `AlignY` and `AlignZ` answer with the extent to ask for, and leave the extent of a shader that carries no such requirement as it is. The threads the rounding adds run the body over coordinates past the extent being worked on, so a shader dispatched over a rounded extent has to hold for them. A dispatch taking fewer than three extents fixes the ones it does not take at one, so a shader whose thread group is deeper than one thread on those axes has to be given them as well.
- `ComputeWeave.Dxc` bundles `dxcompiler.dll` and `dxil.dll` and therefore runs only in x64 and Arm64 processes.
- `Hlsl.Abort` cannot be used in a Direct2D effect. Effect linking, which the default compile options request, builds the shader as a library, and FXC rejects `abort` there; an effect built without that library compiles but then fails to load.

## Notes

- The canonical descriptor is the contract between the generator and the runtime. Both sides ship in the same version and a descriptor written by one version is not intended to be read by another.
- A submission is not awaited implicitly. Call `ComputeSubmission.Wait()` when the result is needed.
- `Dispose` requests the release of a registration; `WaitForDisposal` blocks until it has completed. Work still in flight keeps the generation it captured alive.
- `GraphicsDevice.GetDefault()` caches the device for the process and returns the same instance until it is disposed.
- The `DeviceLost` event on `GraphicsDevice` is raised at most once per instance. After the device is lost, the public APIs throw `InvalidOperationException`.
- `Hlsl.Mul` and `Hlsl.Dot` of unsigned values are unsigned, so an expression that divides the result divides as integers.
- The `AppContext` switches are named `COMPUTEWEAVE_ENABLE_DEBUG_OUTPUT`, `COMPUTEWEAVE_ENABLE_DEVICE_REMOVED_EXTENDED_DATA` and `COMPUTEWEAVE_ENABLE_GPU_TIMEOUT`. They can also be set through the `ComputeWeaveEnableDebugOutput`, `ComputeWeaveEnableDeviceRemovedExtendedData` and `ComputeWeaveEnableGpuTimeout` MSBuild properties.
